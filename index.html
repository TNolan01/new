            <h2>The 1983 Crash</h2>
            <p>The 1983 crash of the home console market left many companies bankrupt and removed Atari, one of the largest companies, from the market.</p>
            <p>Sales were so bad that Atari destroyed unsold games, buring them in the New Mexico desert. The only player left stand was Nintendo, holding a 90%+ share of the market. </p>

            <h2>Innovation</h2>
            <p>Largely unaffected by the crash in US, the large electronic companies in Japan continued to develop home consoles. NEC, Nintendo, Microsoft Japan and Sega all developed consoles for the home market.</p> 
            <p>Back in America, Atari struggled with crippling debt, as sales continued to plummet many believe there was no market for gaming consoles.</p>

            <h2>SEGA</h2>
            <p>SEGA Japan were looking to move from the arcade market. SEGA's intial system, branded the Master System, had an 8bit CPU. Although slightly more powerful than the Nintendo it had no real market impact.</p>
            <p>As Nintendo's dominance continued SEGA went back to design. In Japan NEC had started to develop a 16bit machine. SEGA followed.</p>

            <h2>A star is born</h2>
            <p>In October 1988 SEGA released the Mega Drive to the Japanese market. Well recieved by critics the launch was largely over shadowed by the release of Super Mario Bros 3 on the Nintendo.</p>
            <p>Copyright forced the SEGA to launch in America as Genesis. Struggling for a distributor, SEGA decided to use their largely dormant SEGA US company to launch the product. </p>

            <p>By 1991 SEGA US were still unhappy with sales, they hired Tom Kalinske. Kalinske had massive success as CEO of toy maker Mattel but his 'western' approach to business, pricing and attack advertising put him in conflict with SEGA Japan.</p>
