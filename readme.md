<h1>The MEGADRIVE

## Project Scope:

This site is designed for fans and potential fans of gaming, gaming consoles and retro electronics. The principal aim of the site to atttact and interest fans of the gaming console the SEGA Mega Drive, also known as the Genesis.
The site hopes to generate feelings of nostalgia from an audience whom would have originally used the console as a child while also appealing to the current generations who may be interested in gaming and associated pop culture.

In recent years a market has developed retro and vintage technology with the youth market being interested in collectables and pop iconography associated with video games and gaming franchises.

## Features Of The Site:

The site consists of the following sections.

 - The Main Page - index.hmtl
 - The Gallery Page - gallery.html
 - Sign-up Page - sign_up.html
 - Shop Page - shop_html
 - Header Section
 - Footer Section

**The Main Page**:
The Main Page is a CSS Grid structure containing grid items which each contain text with an associated image to detail the history and life cycle of the console. The principal idea is to make a compelling argument for the historical importance of this console in creating one of the largest entertainment industries in the world.

**The Gallery**:
The Gallery Page is a collection of images of the games associated with the Mega Drive / Genesis platform. These images make a vibrant collage and on their own are visually appealing. Such images can invoke interest and nostalgia.

**The Sign Up Page**:
This is to gather email contact details to use to send 'newsletters' potential followers, fans and customers. The page contains a GIF image from a popular game as part of a simple quiz to entice viewers to sign up.

**The Header and Footer**:
The header and footer are identical across all pages and designed to be modern and non-distracting but visually prominent so as to be borders to the particular page.

## Design Stylings:

The background is a white and light grey sqauare pattern which is based on the color scheme used in some of the orignal game packaging. The background is light as to not distract from the items on the page and give the site a cleaner, modern appearance.

The header and footer are black to clearly distinguish them on the back ground. The icons and text are a blue color, rgb(109, 175, 230). This is taken from the blue in the Mega Drive logo. The silver in the logo was too light a color to use.

The color of Header and Footer icons change color on 'hover' , that color is rgb(156, 134, 9), this is a gold color and is abstract to the blue for differentiation purposes. The gold color was inspired by the gold text on the '16 Bit' Logo which was on the emblazed across the front casing of the MK1 Mega Drive case and Genesis.

I have used the font Orbitron from Google Fonts. Originally I looked for a 'retro' 80's computer style but these fonts appeared clumsy and difficult to read on smaller screens. Orbitron and the shape but with a modern finish.

The shape of the form is a silhouette of the Megadrive 2 console. The red submit button is based on the 'power' and 'reset' buttons on that console.
