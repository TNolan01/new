**The Header and Footer**:
The header and footer are identical across all pages and designed to be modern and non-distracting.



## Design Scope:

The principal background colors were to be white or very light as to not distract from the items on the page and give the site a cleaner, modern appearance.

The header and footer are back to clear distinguish them on the back ground. The icons and text are a blue color,  
rgb(109, 175, 230). This is taken from the blue in the Mega Drive logo. The silver in the logo is to light to use. 
The color of Header and Footer icons change color on 'hover' , that color is rgb(156, 134, 9), this is a gold color and is abstract to the blue for differentiation purposes. The gold color was inspired by the gold text on the '16 Bit' Logo which was on the casing of the MK1 Mega Drive case.
